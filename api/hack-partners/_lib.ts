// #HACK2026 Dubai partner page: storage, device lock and owner alerts.
//
// The page is for about ten friends in the UAE, and the document it comes
// from says "share in person, don't post or forward". So nothing is public:
//
//   - The words live on the server (_content.ts) and are sent only to a
//     browser holding a valid personal link: ministry.xerxesduane.com/hp/<code>.
//   - Each person gets their own code, made by the owner on /hp. A code can be
//     revoked at any time, and every code expires on EXPIRES_AT.
//   - A code opens on at most MAX_DEVICES devices, the first ones to open it.
//     A forwarded link fails on a third device, and the owner gets an email.
//   - Guessing is pointless (128-bit codes) and rate limited anyway.
//   - Responses are no-store and noindex; the page loads no analytics.
//
// Storage is the site's Redis, under hackp:v1:
//   invites            hash, code -> Invite JSON
//   seen:<code>        Seen JSON: devices and countries it was opened from
//   places             how many of the ten places are taken (set by hand, or
//                      worked out from recorded gifts: AED 300 a place)
//   updates            list, newest first: Update JSON the owner posts for every partner
//   spend              list, newest first: Spend JSON, what the money went on
//   statement          "1" while partners can see the money statement
//
// The owner signs in with the same login as /letters (api/work/session).
