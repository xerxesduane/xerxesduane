// Generates src/data/toolLogos.ts from the two icon packages.
//
// Run: npm run logos
//
// Why generate rather than import at runtime: simple-icons alone is 3,459
// icons. The strip needs a couple of dozen, so the paths are extracted at build
// time and the packages stay devDependencies that never reach a browser.
//
// LICENSING. Simple Icons ships its SVGs under CC0 and Devicon under MIT, so
// the icon *files* are free to use. The marks themselves remain their owners'
// trademarks, which is fine here because the strip is nominative use: it says
// "tools I work with" and claims no endorsement or partnership. Keep that
// label honest if the section is ever reworded.
//
// Several brands are in neither package on purpose rather than by oversight.
// Microsoft, Adobe, OpenAI and VS Code marks were removed from Simple Icons
// under its trademark policy, which is why VS Code, Azure, Photoshop and
// Premiere Pro come from Devicon instead, and why Codex, Groq and CapCut have
// no licensed mark available at all. Those three fall back to a monogram in
// the site's own accent rather than a guessed-at imitation of their logo.
