// Why this exists. Prices reach the page through two joins: by service title
// for the cards on the home page, and by service page slug for the headers and
// the Schema.org offers. Both fail silently. A mistyped title just renders a
// card with no price, and a mistyped slug ships a Service node with no offer,
// which looks fine to everyone except the search engines the prices are there
// for. That exact bug was written and caught by hand once; this is so it cannot
// be shipped a second time.
//
// The charity check is arithmetic rather than a join, but it belongs here for
// the same reason: a wrong number on this site is a promise to a stranger.
