 * #HACK2026 Dubai: everything the /hack page says, in one place.
 *
 * WHAT MAY GO HERE. Only what the participant invitation and the public
 * posters already say. The internal hack plan is for the core team and stays
 * out of this file: no venue or host, no names beyond the two Champions who
 * sign the invitation (Xerxes and Abel), no budget,
 * no trusted-track work, no target audiences beyond "churches and faith
 * sites". The page is unlisted (see UNLISTED_ROUTES in lib/seo.ts), but an
 * unlisted page is still a public page to anyone holding the link.
 *
 * Detailed challenge briefs (who a track serves, research, data sources)
 * go to registered teams privately, never onto this page. The page keeps
 * a public summary of the seven challenges and says the full brief
 * comes privately.
 *
 * NEXT YEAR. Change the dates, the form link and the copy here. The page
 * works out which gathering is next, and whether registration is still open,
 * from EVENTS and REGISTRATION at view time.
