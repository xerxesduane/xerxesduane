                        I&rsquo;m Xerxes Duane Magdaluyo, a Filipino minister serving in Dubai, with a
                        heart for faith, missions, and technology. I grew up in a church-school
                        community in Las Piñas, came to a clear call to full-time ministry at 21, and
                        had that call set on fire by a mission trip to Myanmar and a growing burden for
                        people who have never heard the gospel.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Since 2017 I&rsquo;ve worked mostly with the young. My first full-time
                        ministry was as a campus missionary, from 2017 to 2018, and from 2018 to 2021
                        I was youth pastor at Faith in Christ Fellowship in Baguio, leading the youth
                        leaders team: developing youth, training leaders, and helping students grow into people who can disciple
                        others. Across camps, conferences, and campuses I&rsquo;ve trained more than 10,000
                        youths and students, and watched many of them begin to lead on their own.
                        Alongside the youth ministry in Baguio I studied at Philippine Baptist
                        Theological Seminary, and graduated with a Master of Divinity in May 2021.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Along the way I kept finding myself where ministry meets technology. From 2021
                        to 2022, during the pandemic, I served as worship and digital ministry pastor
                        at Bacolod City Alliance Church, leading the worship and Sunday service team
                        and building an e-learning platform so discipleship could continue when
                        gatherings could not. That season settled a conviction I
                        still hold: the tools of our age are meant to serve the mission of God.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The denomination saw that work and brought me into the National Office of
                        CMA-Philippines as Communications Officer, from 2022 to 2023. There I started
                        the organization&rsquo;s digital ministry: pioneering its social media ministry,
                        its websites and YouTube, and the filming of its church-planting ministry.
                        From 2023 to 2024 I served as associate pastor at CAA Alliance Christian
                        Church, handling its youth and digital ministry, and from 2023 to 2025 my
                        home church in the Philippines sent me out as a freelance missionary, on mission to islands across the Philippines and to Phayao,
                        Thailand, filming church-planting ministries.
                        That road led me to Indigitous #HACK in Manila, then to the 4th Lausanne
                        Congress in Seoul, South Korea, and on to Dubai.

                      would use ordinary faithfulness for extraordinary purposes, among the many
                      nations He has gathered here in the Middle East.

                    The call was confirmed in Seoul, but it didn&rsquo;t begin there. It grew over

                  <H3>Where it began</H3>
                  <p>
                    I came to a clear call to full-time ministry at 21. A mission trip to Myanmar
                    set that call on fire, and left me with a growing burden for people who have
                    never heard the gospel.

                  <H3>From the Philippines to the nations</H3>
                  <p>
                    My first full-time ministry was on campus, as a campus missionary from 2017 to
                    2018. From 2018 to 2021 I was youth pastor at Faith in Christ Fellowship in
                    Baguio, and in 2021 I completed my Master of Divinity at Philippine Baptist
                    Theological Seminary there. Then, from 2021 to 2022, during the pandemic, I
                    served as worship and digital ministry pastor at Bacolod City Alliance Church,
                    and from 2022 to 2023 as Communications Officer at the National Office of
                    CMA-Philippines, where I started its digital ministry. From 2023 to 2024 I was
                    associate pastor at CAA Alliance Christian Church, handling its youth and digital
                    ministry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    From 2023 to 2025 my home church in the Philippines sent me out as a freelance
                    missionary. That took me on mission to islands across the Philippines and to
                    Phayao, Thailand, filming church planters at work. One fundraising film helped
                    fund a church-planting building in Batanes.

                    At Indigitous #HACK in Manila I was a champion in 2023 and a coach in 2024, and
                    it was through #HACK that I was nominated for the 4th Lausanne Congress.

                  <p>
                    My call to missions in the Middle East was clarified and confirmed at the{" "}
                    <Ext href="https://congress.lausanne.org/">4th Lausanne Congress</Ext>.
                    Surrounded by global leaders, missionaries, and church planters, I sensed God
                    press a deep conviction on my heart: the nations are not far away. They are
                    already gathered here.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In that space of prayer, worship, and listening, I felt a clear invitation from
                    the Lord to serve among the nations in the Middle East: walking with seekers,
                    discipling new believers, and helping local churches steward the harvest God is
                    bringing. It was not a moment of emotion but of alignment, where calling,
                    burden, and obedience met.
                  </p>

                  <H3>How God led me to Dubai</H3>
                  <p>
                    I was honestly overwhelmed when the invitation came to attend the 4th Lausanne
                    Congress onsite. I was still young in ministry, with little to show next to
                    many who would be there, and the cost was high: over USD 2,000. In the
                    beginning, the doubt was very real.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After prayer, my parents&rsquo; wise counsel, and the encouragement of my
                    community, I took a step of faith. I paid the USD 100 reservation and trusted
                    God with the rest. Not long after, an email from Lausanne told me everything was
                    fully covered. All that remained was to apply for my Korean visa and book my
                    flight. It was a clear reminder that when God calls, He also provides. Praise
                    God.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What happened next still feels mind-blowing. Out of more than 5,000 people at the Congress, I met Pastor Bhaveshkumar Nagda,
                    and that one encounter opened doors I could never have planned. Pastor Bhavesh
                    turned out to be my fiancée&rsquo;s teacher in Tribes and Mission, and through
                    him I was connected to pastors serving in Dubai. Those relationships eventually
                    led me to Pastor Bill Koogler of Fellowship Dubai.

                    At the same time, God was shaping my personal life. I married my wife, Loraine,
                    on December 18, 2024, and we began preparing for a new season together. After
                    the Congress I moved to Dubai, found work in digital marketing and website
                    development for businesses, and served there for about ten months. In May 2025, Pastor Bill invited me to apply as an apprentice at
                    Fellowship Dubai, and in September 2025 I was officially hired. I completed the
                    apprenticeship in September 2026 and continue serving there as a volunteer.

                    Looking back, what first felt like an impossible invitation became the doorway
                    God used to lead me into missions in the Middle East. From faith, to provision,
                    to relationships, to calling, every step was clearly His. This conviction
                    continues to shape how I live and serve in Dubai today, trusting God to use
                    ordinary faithfulness for extraordinary purposes.

                      students to run Alpha and Alpha Youth themselves, helping churches disciple
                      people in everyday life, and equipping believers to use digital tools for
                      ministry.

                      Preaching is a sacred trust. It grew in my years as a youth pastor in Baguio
                      and in the seminary pulpit, and carried on in local churches and youth
                      gatherings across the Philippines. Here
                      in the UAE, I&rsquo;d count it a joy to open God&rsquo;s Word with your church
                      too. These are a few of those moments, in the order they happened.

                      Worship leading has been part of my ministry for years, and it has followed
                      the same road: from Alliance churches in the Philippines to the nations
                      gathered here in the UAE. These days I have the joy
                      of helping lead worship in a multicultural Fellowship Dubai church plant in
                      Sharjah, where people from many languages and backgrounds lift one song to God.
                      Whatever the room, my heart is the same: to help people meet Jesus and respond
                      to Him honestly.
