                        Resolved: to live in a way that consistently reflects King Jesus&rsquo; beauty
                        and excellence in every part of life.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I&rsquo;m Xerxes Duane Magdaluyo, a Filipino minister serving in Dubai, with a
                        heart for faith, missions, and technology. I grew up in a church-school
                        community in Las Piñas, came to a clear call to full-time ministry at 21, and
                        had that call set on fire by a mission trip to Myanmar and a growing burden for
                        people who have never heard the gospel.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        For more than seven years I&rsquo;ve worked mostly with the young: developing
                        youth, training leaders, and helping students grow into people who can disciple
                        others. Across camps, conferences, and campuses I&rsquo;ve trained around 2,000
                        youths and students, and watched many of them begin to lead on their own.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Along the way I kept finding myself where ministry meets technology. During the
                        pandemic I served as a digital-ministry pastor in a local Christian and
                        Missionary Alliance church, building an e-learning platform so discipleship
                        could continue when gatherings could not. That season settled a conviction I
                        still hold: the tools of our age are meant to serve the mission of God.

                      nations He has gathered here in the Middle East.

                    My call to missions in the Middle East was clarified and confirmed at the{" "}
                    <Ext href="https://congress.lausanne.org/">4th Lausanne Congress</Ext>.
                    Surrounded by global leaders, missionaries, and church planters, I sensed God
                    press a deep conviction on my heart: the nations are not far away. They are
                    already gathered here.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In that space of prayer, worship, and listening, I felt a clear invitation from
                    the Lord to serve among the nations in the Middle East: walking with seekers,
                    discipling new believers, and helping local churches steward the harvest God is
                    bringing. It was not a moment of emotion but of alignment, where calling,
                    burden, and obedience met.
                  </p>

                  <H3>How God led me to Dubai</H3>
                  <p>
                    I was honestly overwhelmed when the invitation came to attend the 4th Lausanne
                    Congress onsite. I was only beginning in ministry, with little to show next to
                    many who would be there, and the cost was high: over USD 2,000. In the
                    beginning, the doubt was very real.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After prayer, my parents&rsquo; wise counsel, and the encouragement of my
                    community, I took a step of faith. I paid the USD 100 reservation and trusted
                    God with the rest. Not long after, an email from Lausanne told me everything was
                    fully covered. All that remained was to apply for my Korean visa and book my
                    flight. It was a clear reminder that when God calls, He also provides. Praise
                    God.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What happened next still feels mind-blowing. Out of more than 5,000 people at the Congress, I met Pastor Bhaveshkumar Nagda,
                    and that one encounter opened doors I could never have planned. Pastor Bhavesh
                    turned out to be my fiancée&rsquo;s teacher in Tribes and Mission, and through
                    him I was connected to pastors serving in Dubai. Those relationships eventually
                    led me to Pastor Bill Koogler of Fellowship Dubai.

                    At the same time, God was shaping my personal life. I married my wife, Loraine,
                    on December 18, 2024, and we began preparing for a new season together. After
                    the Congress I moved to Dubai, found work, and served there for about ten
                    months. In May 2025, Pastor Bill invited me to apply as an apprentice at
                    Fellowship Dubai, and in September 2025 I was officially hired.

                    Looking back, what first felt like an impossible invitation became the doorway
                    God used to lead me into missions in the Middle East. From faith, to provision,
                    to relationships, to calling, every step was clearly His. This conviction
                    continues to shape how I live and serve in Dubai today, trusting God to use
                    ordinary faithfulness for extraordinary purposes.

                      Sharjah, where people from many languages and backgrounds lift one song to God.
                      Whatever the room, my heart is the same: to help people meet Jesus and respond
                      to Him honestly.

                Some partners also help sustain the ministry financially, which frees me to serve
                churches and leaders who could not otherwise bring me in. If you&rsquo;d like to give,
                monthly or one time, I would be grateful.

                A note to my kababayan, and to anyone supporting family back home: please feel no
                pressure to give. If your hands are full caring for those you love, your prayers are
                full partnership, and they mean the world to me.
