 * Shared viewport config so sections reveal once, as they enter view.

 * The threshold is intentionally low. `amount` is the fraction of the element's
 * area that must be on screen to trigger the reveal. A tall, single-column
 * section on mobile can be 5–6× the viewport height, so its maximum possible
 * on-screen fraction is only ~0.17 — an `amount` of 0.2 could never be reached
 * and the section would stay hidden forever (this is exactly what broke the
 * home-page service cards on phones). 0.05 reveals as soon as a sliver enters,
 * which is reliable for sections of any height.
