/**
 * The assistant's conversation state.
 *
 * Kept out of the panel so the UI file is layout and the transport is here.
 *
 * `turnsRef` is the source of truth for *reading* the thread; `turns` state
 * exists to render it, and `commit` keeps them in step. That split is not
 * ceremony. A functional `setState` updater does not run when you call it —
 * React runs it during the next render — so building the outgoing request
 * inside one sends whatever the variable held beforehand, which is nothing.
 * That shipped once: every message reached the endpoint with an empty
 * `messages` array and came back "Ask a question to start." Reading the ref
 * is synchronous, so the request always carries the thread that exists now.
 *
 * The rest of the behaviour:
 *
 * - The reply is appended as an empty assistant turn *before* the stream
 *   starts, then filled in place, so tokens appear inside a bubble that is
 *   already on screen instead of one that pops in late.
 * - A send while a reply is streaming aborts the old one first, so an
 *   impatient visitor gets the answer to their newest question rather than two
 *   interleaved streams.
 * - A failed turn removes its own empty bubble and surfaces the endpoint's
 *   message. `/api/assistant` returns real copy for its 429 and 503 cases, so
 *   "you're going too fast" and "the assistant is offline" reach the visitor
 *   rather than a generic failure.
 *
 * Nothing is persisted: no localStorage, no server log. The widget tells
 * visitors chats aren't stored, so it must not quietly keep them.
