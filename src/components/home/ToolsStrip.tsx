 * a shared square would have set those two three times smaller than everything
 * beside them. They come out wider instead, which is how a wordmark is meant
 * to be set.
 *
 * The colour rides on a custom property rather than a `fill`, so the dark
 * theme can swap it: a handful of these marks are black or near-black and
 * would otherwise vanish on the dark canvas — the generator works out the
 * replacement from real contrast against that canvas.
 *
 * `aria-hidden` throughout: for a symbol the tool's name sits right beside it
 * in text, and for a wordmark the caller carries the name in an `sr-only`
 * span, so in both cases the mark itself is decoration.

 * the bento board below waits to be hovered. Built on the vendored Magic UI
 * Marquee (components/vendor/Marquee.tsx), which repeats the list to make the
 * loop seamless and marks the repeats `aria-hidden` + `inert` so each tool is
 * announced and tabbed once.
 *
 * It stops on hover and under `prefers-reduced-motion`. The pause control that
 * used to sit in a bordered cell on the right is gone at the owner's request,
 * but not deleted: a continuously moving element needs an off switch that a
 * keyboard can reach (WCAG 2.2.2), and hover is not one. It is hidden the way
 * the skip link is — off-screen until it takes focus, then a real button over
 * the strip's right edge. Tabbing to the strip is the only way to see it.
