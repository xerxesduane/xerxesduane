 * The About card's figure: your illustration, floating.

 * Two motions, both cheap and both transform-only so they never cause layout
 * work: it rises into place once, then breathes on a slow loop. The loop is
 * deliberately long and shallow — at 6s and 10px it reads as "alive" rather
 * than "animated", which is what a static figure at a desk wants.
 *
 * `prefers-reduced-motion` drops both: `MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"` in
 * App.tsx handles the entrance, and the float is gated on the hook here
 * because a `repeat: Infinity` loop is exactly the thing that setting exists
 * to stop.
 *
 * If the artwork 404s, `onError` falls back to the drawn scene rather than
 * leaving a broken-image icon in the card.
